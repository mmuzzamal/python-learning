# Python Learning

Welcome to my Python Learning portfolio! 🚀

This repository contains my journey through Python fundamentals, organized in a clear and practical way. Each folder focuses on a specific topic, with easy-to-understand explanations and code examples included in a single Markdown file.

---

## 📁 Structure

- 📂 Each folder covers one main topic in Python, such as variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, and data structures.
- 📝 All learning content and code samples are inside the `.md` file of each folder—no separate script files are used.

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio is designed to help me (and others) build a strong foundation in Python, step by step. It’s meant for beginners who want clear explanations and practical examples.

---

## ⏳ Progress

I will continue updating this repository as I learn more Python topics and best practices.
